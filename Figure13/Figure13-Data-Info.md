Figure 13 is a pictoral representation of a quantum network of six oscillators with different frequencies color coded.

ωlist = {2, 3, 4, 5} (oscillator frequencies)

Color = {Red, Green, Yellow, Blue}

Central Frequency, Ω = 4

Single line represents entanglement is initialized between the oscillators at the beginning, t = 0.

Double lines represents entanglement is generated between them a later time (tau), t > 0.
