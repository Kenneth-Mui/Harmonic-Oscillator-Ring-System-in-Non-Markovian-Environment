Closed System Data

Varying Nearest Neighbor Coupling, η = {0.01,..., 0.07} with increments of 0.01.

{n, β, η, m, ω, Ω, γ}

{4, 0, Vary, 1, 1, 1, 0.5}

NOTE: Since β = 0, it doesn't matter that we have set Ω, γ.
The set of differential equations will remove all influence of the environment as a result.
